# Where In The World

## How to use this app

When launching the app the home screen appears. 
On the Home screen you can see a history of your previous games showing the score, distance and when the game was played.
By clicking on the "Start game" button a new game is started on the game screen. 
There you can see a street view of a location on the world. 
The goal is to figure out where you are and set a marker of that location on the google map in the bottom left corner of the screen.

By clicking the green bottom in the bottom right of the google map you can end the game if you are certain about your guess, which takes you to the game overview.
In the game overview the distance between your guess and the actual location is displayed as well as your score. The score is calculated according to how close you were.

From there you can eiter navigate back to the home screen where your history refreshes or you can share the location of the game you just played with a fried.
For sharing the location click on share map and choose a messenger you want to send the link from.

If the recipient of the link has the app installed, a game with the shared location will start by pressing on the link.
